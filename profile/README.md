# Welcome to Hack23! :wave:

We are an organization dedicated to the development of secure open-source software applications and tools. Our mission is to enhance transparency and security in the digital world.

## About Hack23 :information_source:

Hack23 is led by James Pether Sörling, an experienced technology professional with expertise in information security and delivery of secure cloud systems. He is a strong advocate for transparency in organizations and is committed to ensuring the security and reliability of our open-source projects through the use of industry best practices such as OpenSSF and CII Best Practices.

James has given talks at various forums, including Javaforum Göteborg, where he discussed how to secure your development pipeline with static and dynamic application security tests, as well as software composition analysis using Sonarqube. He was also a guest on the Shift Left Like A Boss security podcast, where he discussed open-source tools that can make high-velocity development more secure.

## Our Projects :hammer_and_wrench:

### Citizen Intelligence Agency

The [Citizen Intelligence Agency](https://github.com/Hack23/cia) is a volunteer-driven, open-source intelligence (OSINT) project that provides a neutral and comprehensive dashboard focusing on political activity in Sweden. The platform offers valuable insights into financial performance, risk metrics, and political trends, and features a ranking system for objective comparison of politicians based on performance.

Data Sources:
- [Swedish Parliament Open Data](https://data.riksdagen.se/): This comprehensive database provides a wealth of information related to the Swedish Parliament. It includes data on parliamentary members, committees, and documents, offering a deep dive into the workings of Sweden's legislative body.
- [Swedish Election Authority](https://www.val.se/): This authoritative source provides detailed information on election processes, results, and political parties in Sweden. It's an invaluable resource for anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of Swedish elections.
- [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/): This global database contains a vast array of development data, including economic indicators and demographic information. It's a valuable resource for understanding global trends and comparing Sweden's performance on various metrics with other countries.
- [Swedish National Financial Management Authority (ESV) Public Sector Information (PSI)```markdown
Data](https://www.esv.se/): This data source offers in-depth information on government finances, economic trends, and public sector operations in Sweden. It's a crucial resource for anyone interested in understanding the financial workings of the Swedish government.

This page provides a comprehensive look at our project's system context, its various components, and the deployment strategy. It also includes guides for developers and database administrators, making it a valuable resource for understanding the mechanics of our work.

### Sonar-CloudFormation-Plugin

The [Sonar-CloudFormation-Plugin](https://github.com/Hack23/sonar-cloudformation-plugin) is a plugin for SonarQube that allows users to analyze CloudFormation templates written in YAML or JSON. The plugin uses the SonarQube API to perform code analysis on the templates and generate detailed reports on best practices, potential security issues, and other code quality metrics. The plugin integrates with cfn-nag and Checkov to provide additional security checks based on the CWE, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001 standards.

### Lambda in Private VPC

The [Lambda in Private VPC](https://github.com/Hack23/lambda-in-private-vpc) is a proof-of-concept (POC) showcasing a multi-region active/active site leveraging Resilience Hub policy compliance and runbooks to facilitate rapid recovery from failures.
