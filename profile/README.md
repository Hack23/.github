## Projects

### Citizen Intelligence Agency

Citizen Intelligence Agency is a volunteer-driven, open-source intelligence (OSINT) project that provides a neutral and comprehensive dashboard focusing on political activity in Sweden. By monitoring key political figures and institutions, the platform offers valuable insights into financial performance, risk metrics, and political trends. Additionally, the dashboard features a ranking system, enabling users to objectively compare politicians based on performance. The Citizen Intelligence Agency seeks to encourage informed decision-making, enhance transparency in governance, and cultivate an engaged and well-informed citizenry. The initiative is independent and non-partisan, utilizing data, metadata, and charts related to the Swedish Parliament and government, encompassing parliament members, committees, documents, ballots, decisions, ministries, government members, and political parties.

### Sonar-CloudFormation-Plugin

Sonar-CloudFormation-Plugin is a plugin for SonarQube that allows users to analyze CloudFormation templates written in YAML or JSON. Developed in Java, the plugin uses the SonarQube API to perform code analysis on the templates and generate detailed reports on best practices, potential security issues, and other code quality metrics. It integrates with cfn-nag and Checkov to provide additional security checks based on the CWE, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001 standards.
